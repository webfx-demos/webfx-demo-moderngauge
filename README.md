# Live demo

The demo is published on [this page][demo-live-link].

It just shows a gauge control displayed with one of its skins called 'Modern'.
Here is the [source code][demo-source-link].

# Highlighted features

(in addition to those already explained in the [previous demo][previous-demo-repo-link])

## Reusability

The gauge control was actually already implemented in a JavaFx called [Medusa][hansolo-medusa-link].
This is an example of how you can benefit from the JavaFx ecosystem and reuse or port existing JavaFx libraries in your WebFx applications.

## Custom control

This demo also shows that it's possible to write your own control with the JavaFx API and implement one or even several skins for the same control.
